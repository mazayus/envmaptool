* Support angular and latitude-longitude env maps.
* Cube map filtering takes place in a long running shader, which will probably force most drivers to reset the GPU.
  A potential solution is to spread the work over multiple frames and evaluate a fixed number of samples every frame.
* Remove unused code (this project was extracted from one of my other projects).
* All input .hdr files are treated as RGBE.
* The only supported .hdr resolution string is "-Y +X".
* No compression is performed on output .hdr files.
